## Metallurgy Tweaks

This is a pack of ZenScript scripts and config options to allow Metallurgy to integrate better with other mods. This
script pack was originally created by [Nebby](https://www.curseforge.com/members/nebby_1999) and is now maintained by
Davoleo

_This script was deprecated as of 24/09/2021 all of its core features are now implemented natively in Metallurgy through
IMC_
